This is a Prelimary Investigation into the No Man's Sky spacecraft, how they are defined in the game files and how they are shown in-game

Upon inspection of the game files, with the software No Man's Sky Model Viewer, I am able to open every model in the game files, going back to the E3 2015 Demo (Sidenote that last bit is basically irrelevant but I just care about anything after release)


This isn't really within the scope of my current aims, but I can also view multitools as well which is definitely interesting, this is something that I will have to look into further.

A Prelimary investigation reveals that the spacecraft are categoried first by role, and then the parts are categorised by what they are, for example;

-Cockpit
-Cockpit Neck
-Landing Gear
-Wings
-Engines

Further from this they are then numerated by the alphabet, so A, B, C and so on.

However this means that it is very tricky to search through the list, as there is no filtering and there is only a search box. Although I reckon I might be able to throw something together in Excel that might work. Although it would be a bit tricky and I don't have enough caffeine in me to work it out.

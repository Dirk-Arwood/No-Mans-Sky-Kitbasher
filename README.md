This is a Prelimary Investigation into the No Man's Sky spacecraft, how they are defined in the game files and how they are shown in-game

Upon inspection of the game files, with the software No Man's Sky Model Viewer, I am able to open every model in the game files, going back to the E3 2015 Demo (Sidenote that last bit is basically irrelevant but I just care about anything after release)


This isn't really within the scope of my current aims, but I can also view multitools as well
